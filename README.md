# WCSTinStimulusPresentation
School programming course: Creating a wisconsin card sorting task in stimulus presentation

In this README file aside from an explanation for what this experiment can be used, a few pointers on how to use this scenario are given.

  First, this experiment was created in order to assess an attentional bias towards cannabis related stimuli in 
frequent cannabis users. The idea is that cannabis users:
1. Make more mistakes in general then non-cannabis users
2. Will, in general, have slower reaction times then non-cannabis users
3. Will have slower reaction times when the rule changes from the shape rule to a different rule

Pointers on how to use this scenario:

1.  The way you name your stimuli when you store them in your stim folder is important. 
    It is important that only 3 charachters are used when naming your files.
    In my example one stimulus is named j1y.bmp. 
    The first character (j) stands for the object that is on the picture, in this case a Joint.
    The second character (1) stands for the number of objects on the picture, in this case 1.
    The third character (y) stands for the (backgrond)color of the object, in this case yellow.
    This is important in this scenario because these three characters are used for creating the three sorting rules as well as printing
    filenames in the custom output file.
    
2.  The order of the rules can be randomized. This is done by changing the values in the second loop coded in the PCL

3.  Commentes have been added to the scenario in order to explain what each section of code does
